As a rookie who is starting out with competitive coding , I further down the line aim to create application systems that can provide to the entire world.

I am sure open source softwares are something I advocate for and I shall stray towards the same as I start to get more experienced in the domain of computer science. I see myself exploring cyber security quite a bit too later down the line.

This is my journal to document my journey, projects and wins that I am sure to achieve.

Good luck to my future self.
